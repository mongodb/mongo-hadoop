-- Query Phrase Popularity (local mode)

-- This script processes a search query log file from the Excite search engine and finds search phrases that occur with particular high frequency during certain times of the day.

-- Register the tutorial JAR file so that the included UDFs can be called in the script.

-- Based on the Pig tutorial ,modified for Mongo support tests

-- Use the MongoLoader to query return the fields 'user', 'time', 'query' to Pig
-- Input: (user,time,query) 
raw = LOAD 'mongodb://localhost/demo.excitelog' USING com.mongodb.hadoop.pig.MongoLoader('user', 'time', 'query') AS (user, time, query);

-- Call the NonURLDetector UDF to remove records if the query field is empty or a URL. 
clean1 = FILTER raw BY org.apache.pig.tutorial.NonURLDetector(query);

-- Call the ToLower UDF to change the query field to lowercase. 
clean2 = FOREACH clean1 GENERATE user, time, org.apache.pig.tutorial.ToLower(query) as query;

-- Because the log file only contains queries for a single day, we are only interested in the hour.
-- The excite query log timestamp format is YYMMDDHHMMSS.
-- Call the ExtractHour UDF to extract the hour (HH) from the time field.
houred = FOREACH clean2 GENERATE user, org.apache.pig.tutorial.ExtractHour(time) as hour, query;

-- Call the NGramGenerator UDF to compose the n-grams of the query.
ngramed1 = FOREACH houred GENERATE user, hour, flatten(org.apache.pig.tutorial.NGramGenerator(query)) as ngram;

-- Use the DISTINCT command to get the unique n-grams for all records.
ngramed2 = DISTINCT ngramed1;

-- Use the GROUP command to group records by n-gram and hour.

-- Use the COUNT function to get the count (occurrences) of each n-gram.

-- Use the GROUP command to group records by n-gram only. 
-- Each group now corresponds to a distinct n-gram and has the count for each hour.
uniq_frequency1 = GROUP hour_frequency2 BY group::ngram;

-- For each group, identify the hour in which this n-gram is used with a particularly high frequency.
-- Call the ScoreGenerator UDF to calculate a "popularity" score for the n-gram.

-- Use the FOREACH-GENERATE command to assign names to the fields.

-- Use the FILTER command to move all records with a score less than or equal to 2.0.
filtered_uniq_frequency = FILTER uniq_frequency3 BY score > 2.0;

-- Use the ORDER command to sort the remaining records by hour and score. 
ordered_uniq_frequency = ORDER filtered_uniq_frequency BY hour, score;

-- Use the PigStorage function to store the results. 
-- Output: (hour, n-gram, score, count, average_counts_among_all_hours)
